## How to make an environment

First, there are some concepts you need to know to create a custom experiment.

1. Environment: The environment that the agent interacts with. You may choose one
   from [environments](https://github.com/yhs0602/MinecraftRL/tree/main/code/environments).
   The environment need a name and params to be created.
2. Wrapper: The wrapper helps you to connect your models, algorithms to the environment. It provides custom rewards, or
   observation space conversion.
3. Algorithm: It runs the training and test loops, and log the results. As the algorithm is tightly coupled with the
   model, you may need to implement your own algorithm to use your custom model.

To create a custom experiment, you need to create a new file in `code/experiments` directory. The file name should be
`{your_experiment_name}.yml`. Then, you need to specify the following specs. The specific specs may vary depending on
the algorithm you use.

```yaml
seed: null # The seed to generate the world. If null, the seed will be randomly generated.
env_path: null # The path to the MinecraftEnv project. If null, it will use the default path.
group: jsrl_fish # The name of the group of the experiment. The experiments will be grouped by this name in the wandb console.
record_video: true # Whether to record the video of the experiment.
device: null # The device to run the experiment. If null, it will use the default device.

env: # The environment to run the experiment in.
  name: # The name of the pre-defined environment. You can choose one from the list in environments.py
    params: # The parameters to create the environment. You can see the parameters in environments.py
      hud: true # Whether to show the HUD in the environment.
      verbose: false # Whether to show the verbose information in the environment.
      port: 8000 # Via which port the environment will communicate with this agent.
      render_action: true # Whether to include the agent's action in the video.
      size_x: 256 # The size of the screen in x axis.
      size_y: 256 # The size of the screen in y axis.
